        <p id="para">The National Aeronautics and   Space Administration is an independent agency of the U.S. federal
            government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and space research.
            <br> <br>
            NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new
            agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science.
            Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon
            landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the
            International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch
            System, and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which
            provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
            <br><br>
            NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing
            heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;
            exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons; and
            researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated
            programs.
