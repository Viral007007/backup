        <p>Bruce Wayne, alternately known by his vigilante name The Dark Knight, is a fictional character appearing in the Warner Bros. TV/DC Comics series Gotham, based on the character of the same name who is the secret identity of DC Comics superhero Batman, created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. Gotham portrays Bruce's teenage years and transition into adapting his Batman personality in later years. The series marks the second time Batman was adapted for live-action television after the 1960s Batman series, though the lead character in Gotham is James Gordon. Bruce is portrayed by David Mazouz while Mikhail Mudrik had an uncredited role as the adult Bruce in the series finale (with Mazouz providing the character's voice).</p>
